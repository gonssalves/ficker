# Personal Finance Tracker - Ficker

## Configuration
You should have Python and virtual environment (preferentially) on your machine.
* Use <em>pip install -r requirements.txt</em> to install the packages.
* After the packages are installed, activate the virtual environment with <em>. venv/bin/activate</em>
* While inside the venv, to run the server, use <em>flask --app app run --debug</em> or <em>export FLASK_APP=app</em> and then <em>flask run</em>.

Additionally, you can find our app URL in the 'about' section. Please be patient, though, as the service spins down due to inactivity, so it might take a while to load.
